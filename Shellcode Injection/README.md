# Shellcode Injection

At a high level, shellcode injection can be broken up into four steps:

1. Open a target process with all access rights.
2. Allocate target process memory for the shellcode.
3. Write shellcode to allocated memory in the target process.
4. Execute the shellcode using a remote thread.
